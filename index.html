        Disappointment is inevitable in life, but we must straighten our backs. Without too much foreshadowing and rhetoric, "Bu Ci Ka (Wenzhou dialect, means stand up)" is a very passionate work, a self-encouraging battle song. The pronunciation of the lyrics uses the author Jin Chengzhi\'s native Wenzhou dialect again - in this "Devil\'s Language", "stand up" is pronounced "bu ci ka", which is a bit funny at first, but as the work progresses, its power will be gradually released in the music.
